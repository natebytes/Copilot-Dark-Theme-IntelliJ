    <description><![CDATA[
    Theme inspired by the original colours of the GitHub Copilot website. This theme was initially inspired by Benjamin Benais Copilot theme in VS Code but I have adjusted colours to be more vibrant and higher contract and is unrelated to that project.<br>
    <br>
    Currently I've only designed and customized colours for working with Typescript and Javascript. I will be updating the plugin for Java (although I do use the current state in Java without too many issues) & C in the future. Please feel free to suggest colours or open a PR in the Github for other languages or change in color scheme suggestions.
